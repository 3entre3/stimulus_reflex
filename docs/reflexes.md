# Reflexes

What is a Reflex, really? Is it a transactional UI update that takes place over a persistent open connection to the server? Is it a new tool on your belt that operates adjacent to and in tandem with concepts like REST and Ajax? Is it the smug feelings associated with successfully achieving a massive productivity arbitrage? Is it the boundless potential for unironic good in every child?

A thousand times, _yes_.

## Glossary

* StimulusReflex: the name of this project, which has a JS client and a Ruby based server component that rides along on top of Rails' ActionCable websockets framework
* Stimulus: an incredibly simple yet powerful JS framework by the creators of Rails
* "a Reflex": used to describe the full, round-trip life-cycle of a StimulusReflex operation, from client to server and back again
* Reflex class: a Ruby class that inherits from `StimulusReflex::Reflex` and lives in your `app/reflexes` folder, this is where your Reflex actions are implemented
* Reflex action: a method in a Reflex class, called in response to activity in the browser. It has access to several special accessors containing all of the Reflex controller element's attributes
* Reflex controller: a Stimulus controller that imports the StimulusReflex client library. It has a `stimulate` method for triggering Reflexes and like all Stimulus controllers, it's aware of the element it is attached to - as well as any Stimulus [targets](https://stimulusjs.org/reference/targets) in its DOM hierarchy
* Reflex controller element: the DOM element upon which the `data-reflex` attribute is placed, which often has data attributes intended to be delivered to the server during a Reflex action

## Declaring a Reflex in HTML with data attributes

It is frequently fastest to enable Reflex actions by using the `data-reflex` attribute. The syntax follows Stimulus format: `[DOM-event]->[ReflexClass]#[action]`

```markup
<button data-reflex="click->Comment#create">Create</button>
```

{% hint style="success" %}
The syntax for `data-reflex` was recently loosened; you can now safely omit the string fragment "Reflex" from the Reflex class identifier.

Previously: &lt;div data-reflex="click-&gt;UserReflex\#poke"&gt;  
Now: &lt;div data-reflex="click-&gt;User\#poke"&gt;

Server-side Reflex classes still follow the UserReflex / user\_reflex.rb naming.
{% endhint %}

You can use additional data attributes to pass variables as part of your Reflex payload.

```markup
<button 
  data-reflex="click->Comment#create" 
  data-post-id="<%= @post.id %>"
>Create</button>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Thanks to the magic of [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver), a browser feature that allows StimulusReflex to know when the DOM has changed, StimulusReflex can pick up `data-reflex` attributes on all HTML elements - even if they are dynamically created and inserted into your DOM.

This means that if you parse a client-side markup format that has declarative Reflexes contained within, they will be connected to StimulusReflex in less than a millisecond.
{% endhint %}

### Declaring multiple Reflex events on an element

Do you want to trigger different Reflex actions for different events? We have you covered!

You can specify multiple Reflex operations by separating them with a space:

```markup
<img src="cat.jpg" data-reflex="mouseenter->Cat#approach mouseleave->Cat#escape">
```

### Inheriting data-attributes from parent elements

You might design your interface such that you have a deeply nested structure of data attributes on parent elements. Instead of writing code to travel your DOM and access those values, you can use the `data-reflex-attributes="combined"` directive to scoop all data attributes up the hierarchy and pass them as part of the Reflex payload.

```markup
<div data-post-id="<%= @post.id %>">
  <div data-category-id="<%= @category.id %>">
    <button data-reflex="click->Comment#create" data-reflex-attributes="combined">Create</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

This Reflex action will have `post-id` and `category-id` accessible:

```ruby
class CommentReflex < ApplicationReflex
  def create
    puts element.dataset["post-id"]
    puts element.dataset["category-id"]
  end
end
```

If a data attribute appears several times, the deepest one in the DOM tree is taken. In the following example, `data-id` would be **2**.

```markup
<div data-id="1">
  <button data-id="2" data-reflex="Example#whatever" data-reflex-dataset="combined">Click me</button>
</div>
```

## Calling a Reflex in a Stimulus controller

Behind the scenes, when you use declarative Reflex calls via `data-reflex` attributes in your HTML, the `stimulate` method on your Stimulus controller is being called. We touched on this briefly in the **Quick Start** chapter; here are the details.

All Stimulus controllers that have had `StimulusReflex.register(this)` called in their `connect` method gain a `stimulate` method.

```javascript
this.stimulate(string target, [DOMElement element], ...[JSONObject argument])
```

**target** \[required\] \(exception: see "Requesting a Refresh" below\): a string containing the server Reflex class and method, in the form "Example\#increment".

**element** \[optional\]: a reference to a DOM element which will provide both attributes and scoping selectors. Frequently pointed to `event.target` in Javascript. **Defaults to the DOM element of the controller in scope**.

**argument** \[optional\]: a **splat** of JSON-compliant Javascript datatypes - array, object, string, numeric or boolean - will be received by the Reflex action as ordered arguments.

### Receiving arguments

When calling `stimulate()` you have the option to send arguments to the Reflex action method. Options have to be JSON-serializable data types and are received in a predictable order. Objects that are passed as parameters are accessible using both symbol and string keys.

```ruby
class CatReflex < StimulusReflex::Reflex
  def adopt(opinions, legs = 4)
    puts opinions["gender"]
    puts opinions[:gender]
  end
end
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note: the method signature has to match.** If the Reflex action is expecting two arguments and doesn't receive two arguments, it will raise an exception.
{% endhint %}

Note that you can only provide parameters to Reflex actions by calling the `stimulate` method with arguments; there is no equivalent for Reflexes declared with data attributes.

### Combined data attributes with `stimulate()`

`data-reflex-dataset="combined"` also works with the `stimulate()` function:

```markup
<div data-folder-id="<%= folder.id %>" data-controller="folders">
  <button data-action="click->folders#edit" data-reflex-dataset="combined">Edit</button>
</div>
```

By default, `stimulate` treats the DOM element that the controller is placed on as the **element** parameter. Instead, we use `event.target` to make the clicked button element be the source of the Reflex action. All combined data attributes will be picked up, and all callbacks and events will emit from the button.

```javascript
import { Controller } from 'stimulus'
import StimulusReflex from 'stimulus_reflex'

export default class extends ApplicationController {
  connect() {
    StimulusReflex.register(this)
  }

  edit(event) {
    this.stimulate("Folder#edit", event.target)
  }
}
```

### Aborting a Reflex

It is possible that you might want to abort a Reflex and prevent it from executing. For example, the user might not have appropriate permissions to complete an action, or perhaps some other side effect like missing data would cause an exception if the Reflex was allowed to continue.

We'll go into much deeper detail on lifecycle callbacks on the [Lifecycle](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/lifecycle) page, but for now it is important to know that if there is a `before_reflex` method in your Reflex class, it will be executed before the Reflex action. **If you call `raise :abort` in the `before_reflex` method, the Reflex action will not execute.** Instead, the client will receive a `halted` event and execute the `reflexHalted` callback if it's defined.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Halted Reflexes do not execute afterReflex callbacks on the server or client.
{% endhint %}

### Requesting a "refresh"

If you are building advanced workflows, there are edge cases where you may want to initiate a Reflex action that does nothing but re-render the view template and morph any new changes into the DOM. While this shouldn't be your primary tool, it's possible for your data to be mutated by destructive external side effects. ðŸ§Ÿ

```javascript
this.stimulate()
```

Calling `stimulate` with no parameters invokes a special global Reflex that allows you to force a re-render of the current state of your application UI. This is the same thing that the user would see if they hit their browser's Refresh button, except without the painfully slow round-trip cycle.

It's also possible to trigger this global Reflex by passing nothing but a browser event to the `data-reflex` attribute. For example, the following button element will refresh the page content every time the user presses it:

```markup
<button data-reflex="click">Refresh</button>
```

## Reflex Classes

StimulusReflex makes the following properties available to the developer inside Reflex actions:

* `connection` - the ActionCable connection
* `channel` - the ActionCable channel
* `request` - an `ActionDispatch::Request` proxy for the socket connection
* `session` - the `ActionDispatch::Session` store for the current visitor
* `url` - the URL of the page that triggered the reflex
* `element` - a Hash like object that represents the HTML element that triggered the reflex
* `params` - query and path params for the page that triggered the reflex and serialized params of the closest form

{% hint style="danger" %}
`reflex` and `process` are reserved words inside Reflex classes. You cannot create Reflex actions with these names.
{% endhint %}

### `element`

The `element` property contains all of the Stimulus controller's [DOM element attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes) as well as other properties like, `tagName`, `checked` and `value`. In addition, `values` and the `dataset` property reference special collections as described below.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Most values are strings.** The only exceptions are `checked` and `selected` which are booleans.

Elements that support **multiple values** such as `<select multiple>` or a collection of checkboxes with the same `name` will emit an additional **`values` property.** In addition, the `value` property will contain a comma-separated string of the checked options.
{% endhint %}

Here's an example that outlines how you can interact with the `element` property and the `dataset` collection in your Reflex action. You can use the dot notation as well as string and symbol accessors.

{% code title="app/views/examples/show.html.erb" %}
```markup
<checkbox id="example" label="Example" checked
  data-reflex="Example#work" data-value="123" />
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="app/reflexes/example\_reflex.rb" %}
```ruby
class ExampleReflex < StimulusReflex::Reflex
  def work()
  
    element.id      # => the HTML element's id in dot notation
    element[:id]    # => the HTML element's id w/ symbol accessor
    element["id"]   # => the HTML element's id w/ string accessor

    element.dataset # => a Hash that represents the HTML element's dataset
    element.values  # => [] only for multiple values

    element["id"]                # => "example"
    element[:tag_name]           # => "CHECKBOX"
    element[:checked]            # => true
    element.label                # => "Example"
    
    element["data-reflex"]       # => "ExampleReflex#work"
    element.dataset[:reflex]     # => "ExampleReflex#work"
    
    element.value                # => "123"
    element["data-value"]        # => "123"
    element.dataset[:value]      # => "123"
    
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="success" %}
When StimulusReflex is rendering your template, an instance variable named **@stimulus\_reflex** is available to your Rails controller and set to true.

You can use this flag to create branching logic to control how the template might look different if it's a Reflex vs normal page refresh.
{% endhint %}

### Params

Provides serialization for form params as `ActionController::Parameters` of the parent form element. 
You can access the params directly in your reflex and use exaclty as you do in ActionControllers, useful for validations and updating multiple attributes of models.

To modify `params` before sending them you can use `beforeReflex` lifecycle event using `element.refelexData`, for example:

```javascript
export default class extends ApplicationController {
  beforeReflex(element) {
    const { params } = element.reflexData
    element.reflexData.params = { ...params, foo: true, bar: false }
  }
}
```

### Reflex exceptions are rescuable

If you'd like to wire up 3rd-party exception handling services like Sentry or HoneyBadger to your Reflex classes, you can use `rescue_from` to respond to an errors raised.

```ruby
class MyTestReflex < StimulusReflex::Reflex
  rescue_from StandardError do |exception|
    ExceptionTrackingService.error(exception)
  end
  # ...
end
```

## Flash messages

One Rails mechanism that you might use less in a StimulusReflex application is the flash message object. Flash made a lot more sense in the era of submitting a CRUD form and seeing the result confirmed on the next page load. With StimulusReflex, the current state of the UI might be updated dozens of times in rapid succession and the flash message could be easily lost before it's read.

You'll want to experiment with other, more contemporary feedback mechanisms to provide field validations and event notification functionality. An example would be the Facebook notification widget, or a dedicated notification drop-down that is part of your site navigation.

Clever use of CableReady broadcasts when ActiveJobs complete or models update is likely to produce a cleaner reactive surface for status information.
